dataset generation:
play games with exploration policy and select a single position from each game
for the initial datasest, use MCTS with 1k sims (100k positions)
each successive iteration, sample positions with apprentice (100k positions)

to generate value network targets, need more than 100k samples, MCTS targets too expensive
EXIT did generate dataset using MC targets with self play of the apprentice policy network
But why not use V(s) backups from MCTS as targets, like TreeStrap in Meep.
